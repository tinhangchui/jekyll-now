Hi! My name is Tin. Welcome to my little showcase!

Decided to go for computer science major during high school, I like coding and building systems. While other people feel frustrated on debugging, I enjoy and stay motivated on getting things work. I am also greatly interested in Artificial Intelligence. My dream project is to build a game with an AI that can generate a different story, rules and graphics in each run. In other words it's a game generator, so player will always experience a new game and never get bored. Therefore, I am interested in many areas of AI including deep reinforcement learning, generative methods, and simulation etc.

I will regularly go over my github repository, pick some interesting projects I involved, and introduce them here. There are good amount of my projects are small and possibly just experimental, but they could be fun and meaningful to me. There are also massive and majestic project I am proud of. If I have on-going project, I may also put the post about their progress here.
